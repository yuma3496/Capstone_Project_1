# Investment Calculator

## Description:
Investment Calculator is a program written in Python. This program was designed for a small financial company, to calculate both simple and compound interest rates.

## Functionality
When run, this program firstly displays a menu to the user. The program will then prompt the user for input with a series of questions, which will capture the information needed to calculate their total investment value over a certain number of years. For example, if the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter the initial deposit amount, interest rate, number of years they plan to invest for, as well as whether they wish to invest with simple or compound interest. The program will then calculate the final investment value based on the user's input and display the results in an easy-to-read, informative sentence.

## How can I use it?
1. You need to close this repository to your local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program. Below is the details of the GitHub help page:
    - https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository
  
2. To run this program, download the Python interpreter program onto your computer's operating system so this program can be excuted. Navigate the following website to download Python on your OS:
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
3. When opened, the IDLE python file will display a Python 'shell' window. From this window, you can now click on 'file' and then 'open' from the toolbar at the top of the window, to navigate to the Finance Calculator program and open it. Once opened, you will be able to view the program code in another file window that will automatically open separately to the Python shell.

4. When you are ready to run it, you can select 'run' from the top toolbar and then interact with the output displayed in the Python shell window. That is where you will be prompted to enter information from your keyboard to choose a calculator and then input the necessary details for calculation.

## Contributions
This was developped individually by myself in the software engineering bootcamp. However, it has been reviewed and commented on by the helpful mentors at Hyperion Development.
